# Summer School in The South Pacific.  
**Bridging the Divides with Globally Engineered Software**  
*January 9th – 11th, 2026*


<p align="center">

</p>

The Summer School is designed to provide participants with practical software solutions in a unique region of the world, while advancing the goal of making software engineering universal—accessible to anyone, anywhere, without technical, cultural, or educational barriers.

Previous editions:
- [BRIDGES 2023](https://naist-se.github.io/PNG-BRIDGES)
- [BRIDGES 2019](https://naist-se.github.io/BRIDGES2019)

With the rise of AI technologies in Software Engineering (SE), this school demonstrates how communities like Papua New Guinea can use these tools to foster equality and democratic participation within their local software ecosystems. For the global SE community, such diverse contexts reveal innovative methods for developing solutions and contributing meaningfully to the open-source (OSS) world.


The 3-day program is taught in *English* and will be held at *Loloata Island Resort*, Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.  
Participants will receive a *certificate of attendance*.

## Venue
BRIDGES2026 will take place at [Loloata resort](https://www.loloataislandresort.com/), which is located on an island off the coast of Port Moresby, capital of Pacific nation, Papua New Guinea (PNG). Known as the land of the unexpected, locals speak over 850 languages and have a diverse culture, flora and fauna (like the Bird of Paradise and the world's largest butterfly, the Queen Alexandra Birdwing), making PNG one of the last untouched locations on the planet.

  <h2>Associate Professor Kelly Blincoe</h2>
  <h3>Finding Your Fit: How Your Thinking Style Shapes Your Software Engineering Experience</h3>
  <p>
    Have you ever felt like software just doesn't "click" with the way you think? Recent research shows this isn't just in your head—some software actually works better for certain thinking styles than others. This is also true for the software tools that software engineers use to build and maintain software. I'll share our studies on two widely-used tools: the PyCharm debugger (which helps find and fix bugs) and GitHub Copilot (an AI coding assistant). You'll learn about the inclusivity issues we found and, more importantly, discover practical strategies for working with these tools effectively, regardless of your natural thinking style. I'll also help you identify your own cognitive preferences so you can choose approaches that work best for you as you begin your software engineering journey.
  </p>

  <h2>Associate Professor MarK Cheong</h2>

  <img align="right" height="200" src="https://www.marccheong.com/assets/img/profile.jpg?1dd43b32d7c4bc761862b0e2e2a91400">
  <h3>Responsible Use of Generative AI and Open Source Tools for Good</h3>
  <p>
    Following from previous BRIDGES events, researchers have identified that building software with open source tools (and possibly generative AI) could empower young people and uplift them with career-building skills. Generative AI products, from ChatGPT to Claude Code, have the potential to improve productivity, and more importantly, become a resource for learning about software development.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, AI—against the broader tech ecosystem—has been known to cause issues such as: perpetuating 'AI slop' and misinformation; exhibiting social biases or amplifying them; causing unwanted harms and side effects; violating privacy and potentially misusing others' work! This, combined with the proprietary nature of many extant software products, might raise some ethical questions on what it means to use them 'responsibly' and 'for good'.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this talk, I will provide a primer of four key ethical principles in the area of AI ethics, and explain their applicability in our use of technology (including AI), as well as what they mean for developers, users, and other stakeholders.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then, I will discuss the benefits found in initiatives such as the open source movement and others in promoting accessibility, fairness, and equality of opportunity. Finally, some practical tips will be offered to participants on how they can begin their journey as software developers in a responsible and ethical manner, by learning from the various issues surrounding contemporary technology, and adopting responsible usage/development practices.

<h3>Empirical Software Engineering and Agentic Coding</h3>
<p>
  Yutaro Kashiwa is an Associate Professor at the Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), Japan. 
  He earned his Ph.D. in Engineering from Wakayama University in 2020. Prior to his academic career, 
  he worked as a full-time software engineer at Hitachi Ltd. for two years and subsequently served as 
  a research fellow at the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) for three years.
</p>
<p>
  From 2020 to 2022, he was a postdoctoral researcher on a Swiss-Japan collaborative project funded by 
  the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) and JSPS, led by Yasutaka Kamei and Gabriele Bavota. 
  He joined NAIST as an Assistant Professor in 2022 and was promoted to Associate Professor in 2025.
</p>
<p>
  His research focuses on empirical software engineering, with particular interest in agentic coding, 
  software testing, refactoring, and release processes.
