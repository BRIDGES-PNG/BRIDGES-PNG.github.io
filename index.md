# About

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Software powers our everyday lives. The First International Workshop on Intertwining Research & Education on Software (WIREDS2024) is a pioneering initiative designed to bridge the gap between research and education within the Japanese software community to bring top class research to the global community. This workshop aims to foster an environment where expert researchers, students, educators, and practitioners can engage in meaningful dialogue about cutting-edge and disruptive innovations in software development and engineering.
<br>
<br>
WIREDS2024 seeks to establish a local platform for the next generation of younger researchers in Japan by brining in rising stars from the global. The workshop is committed to cultivating a collaborative atmosphere that encourages the sharing of diverse perspectives, ultimately contributing to the growth and evolution of software researchâ€”not only in Japan but in a way that is mutually beneficial for the global community.
<br>
<br>
The theme for WIREDS 2024 is the "Disruptive Innovation of Generative AI". We will be inviting experts from the Global SE community to share some ideas and provide feedback to our Japanese community.
